        There are many species identifier systems available in the market but they consist of a lot many errors with less accuracy and are even costly.
        Current Systems available in the market are limited to local bird species and are dependent on the environmental factors but the system that we are developing can classify           up to 200 bird species and it can be scaled up.
       Thus this system is a better approach for species identification with higher accuracy.
