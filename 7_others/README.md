This system is capable of identifying the bird species from an image. As fine-grained processing is difficult, it becomes difficult to process when more than one species of bird is present in the provided image. There are also other reasons such as small birds, lighting conditions not suitable, the similarity in bird body parts and camouflage conditions. Such conditions are difficult to overcome in neural networks. Other limitations are to learn those discriminative features (both micro features like color, gradients, textures, etc. and macro features like shape, color patch, etc.). Various lighting conditions ( like a picture taken during daylight, dawn, dusk, evening, etc.) affected our model most as due to low background light, many micro-features of the bird-like color, texture, gradients, etc. are lost.
