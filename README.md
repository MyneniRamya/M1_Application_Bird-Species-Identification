 M1_Application_BirdSpeciesIdentification
 
      Identification of bird species is a challenging task often resulting in ambiguous labels. 
      Even professional bird viewers sometimes fail to recognize the species given an image of a bird. It is a difficult problem that pushes the limits of the visual abilities for   both humans and computers.
      Although different bird species share the same basic set of parts, different bird species can vary dramatically in shape an appearance.
 Intraclass variance is high due to variation in lighting and background and extreme variation in pose (e.g., flying birds, swimming birds, and perched birds).
 Our project aims to employ  to help amateur bird watchers identify bird species from the images they captured.
